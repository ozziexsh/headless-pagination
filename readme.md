View demo at [headless-pagination.ozzie.sh](https://headless-pagination.ozzie.sh) and the source for the example [in the docs folder](./docs/src/App.tsx).

Small javascript library that helps you with what data and links to display for your pagination.

Does not render anything to the UI, nor does it know anything about your data other than the size of it.

## Libraries:

- Vanilla JS - [headless-pagination](./packages/headless-pagination)
- React adapter - [headless-pagination-react](./packages/headless-pagination-react)
